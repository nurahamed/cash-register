### Cash Register App

#### Overview

This JavaScript application is designed to help users calculate and manage change when processing transactions. It includes a simple HTML user interface with bill amount input, cash given input, and a button to calculate the change. The app provides a breakdown of the change in various currency notes.

#### Features

1. **Input Validation:**
   - The application validates that the entered bill amount is a positive number.
   - It ensures that the cash given is greater than or equal to the bill amount.

2. **Change Calculation:**
   - When the "Check" button is clicked, the app calculates the change to be returned.
   - It then breaks down the change into the available currency notes (2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - If the bill amount is invalid or if the cash given is insufficient, an error message is displayed.
   - The error message disappears when a valid input is provided.

#### Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter the bill amount and cash given in the respective input fields.
3. Click the "Check" button to calculate the change.
4. The result, including the total amount returned and the breakdown of currency notes, is displayed.
